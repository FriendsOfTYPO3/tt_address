Important changes
-----------------

Supported & Required TYPO3 versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **TYPO3 9**: This release is the last planned one which will support TYPO3 9.
- **TYPO3 10**: If the new pagination API is used, TYPO3 10.4.13 is required
- **TYPO3 11**: This is the 1st version which supports 11.0

Support of Pagination API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Since TYPO3 10 a new pagination API has been introduced as the pagination via widgets has been marked as deprecated.
Read more about it at https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/master/en-us/ApiOverview/Pagination/Index.html.

To simplify updates and getting you used to this API, this release includes the new paginiation API as well.

.. note::

   It needs to be enabled in the extension settings globally and is disabled by default.

Please be aware that the routing configuration needs to be adopted as the name of the variable changed from `[widget_0][currentPage]=2` to `[currentPage]=2`!
