Important changes
-----------------

The following changes could be breaking for you.

Handling of field `name`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The field `name` is **not** filled automatically anymore by the first and last name and the field will be remove with one of the next versions.

Code cleanup
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following code cleanups have been added:

- Removal of translated XLF files: Download the translations from the translation server via Install Tool.
- Strict types and type hints have been added

Features
--------

Improved record title in backend
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is possible to change the used fields for the title of the record by TsConfig.
This is nice if using the extension for various purposes, e.g. locations and newsletter subscriptions.

.. code-block:: typoscript

    # Page TsConfig
    tt_address.label = name;last_name,first_name;email

Each label group is divided by `;` and each group can hold a list of field names.

1. In the given example, the value of the field `name` is shown if filled.
2. If the field is empty, the values of the fields `last_name` and `first_name` are shown.
3. If this combination is still empty, the email address is shown


New properties & getters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The field `titleSuffix` has been added
- The getter `getFirstCategory` has been added to make it easier in fluid to retrive the first category with `{address.firstCategory}`.

New ViewHelpers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following ViewHelpers have been added:

- :fluid:`<address:clean.domain />`
- :fluid:`<address:clean.phoneNumber />`

Those trigger the same cleaning as :fluid:`{address.cleanedPhoneNumber}` and :fluid:`{address.wwwSimplified}`.

If address records are retrieved directly, e.g. by using a DataProcessor, it is possible to clean the values as in the templates.
