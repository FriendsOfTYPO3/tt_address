Rich snippets
=============
When you use structured data to mark up content, you help
Google better understand its context for display in Search, and you achieve better distribution of your content to
users from Search. (quote by google)

The full article can be found at https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/mark-up-content

The extension `tt_address` follows the guidelines and adds the proper information to every output of a field.

Testing
-------
If the templates are modified it is important to test if the markup is still valid regarding the rich snippets.

Google provides an online tool at https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/ which can be used for that.
