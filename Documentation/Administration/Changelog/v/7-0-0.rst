Important changes
-----------------

The following changes could be breaking for you.

Support of TYPO3 12
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
12.0 has been released on 4th of October 2022. Read more about it at https://typo3.org/article/typo3-v120-release-your-power!
No breaking changes are planned anymore which makes it possible for extensions to start to be compatible with the next awesome TYPO3 version.

.. important::

    Support of TYPO3 11 will be kept. Currently PHP 7.4 is still supported by EXT:tt_address and *currently* there are no plans to drop that but this might change in the future. Please update to PHP 8.x!

Drop support of TYPO3 10
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the release of version 7, the support of TYPO3 10 has been stopped.
tt_address is kind of feature complete and without known bugs, therefore no further 6.x releases are planned.

Removal of automatic redirect in detail view
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Previously a redirect has been triggered in the detail view if no record has been found.
This redirect has been removed.
