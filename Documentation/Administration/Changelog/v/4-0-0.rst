Important changes
-----------------

Deprecated pi1 plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The plugin based on `AbstractPlugin` (formerly known as pibase) has been marked as deprecated and will be removed with
version 5.0.0. If you still want to use this version you need to enable it in the settings of the extension manager.

Changed vendor name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The vendor name has been changed from `TYPO3` to `FriendsOfTYPO3`. This change is only relevant if you or any extension
you are using extends tt_address.

Installing the extension via composer **did not** change and is still `composer req friendsoftypo3/tt-address`.

Features
--------

Extbase & Fluid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A new plugin has been added which is based on extbase & fluid, 2 very well known concepts of TYPO3 and its eco system.

The default templates are based on Twitter Bootstrap to have a well known code base.

Rich snippets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The templates integrate rich snippets for every field by default.

Code base
^^^^^^^^^
The code base of tt_address has been changed and improved in every area. To keep the quality high, the whole code base
is now covered with unit and functional tests which are executed with every commit and pull request.
