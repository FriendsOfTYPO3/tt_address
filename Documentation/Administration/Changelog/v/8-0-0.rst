Important changes
-----------------

Better CSP support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CSP (Content Security Policy) can be used to prevent loading inline styles.
Therefore some styles have been extracted into a separate CSS file.

Additionally the CSP configuration for TYPO3 v12 has been extended to allow calls to OpenStreetMap!

Database changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- 2 new fields have been added: Instagram + TikTok
- Increased size of the fields `building` + `room`
