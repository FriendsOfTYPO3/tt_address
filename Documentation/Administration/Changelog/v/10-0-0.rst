Breaking Changes
-----------------

Changed plugin registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The usage of the field `list_type` of tt_content has been removed.

Please use the Upgrade Wizard in the Install to migrate existing elements!

Records of hidden storage pages are not rendered
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If a storage page (e.g., a *sysfolder*) containing address records is set to **hidden**,
the related address records will also **not be rendered**.

This behavior allows editors to quickly show or hide groups of news records by simply toggling the visibility of their storage page.

This also enables editors to quickly hide & unhide address records by changing the
visibility of the storage pages.

Drop field `skype`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As skype has been announced as end of life, the field has also been removed from
the address record.

Features
--------

New social fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following social fields have been added:

- linkedincompany
- bluesky
- whatsapp
- youtubechannel
