Important changes
-----------------

This release is the 1st release which supports TYPO3 10 and TYPO3 9 LTS only.
This also means that the support for version 8 has been removed.

However version 8 will be still supported for priority bugfixes in the 4.x branch.

Cleanup codebase
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following code parts have been changed:

- Removal of the piBase/AbstractPlugin plugin
- Removal of the file:`locallang_pi1.xlf` file.
- Removal of the update wizards
- Removal of hook to support EXT:realurl
- Support of php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTENSIONS']['tt_address']` instead of the serialized configuration in :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXT']['extConf']['tt_address']`

Use crowdin for localization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The project uses https://crowdin.com/project/typo3-extension-ttaddress for localization of the xlf files.
