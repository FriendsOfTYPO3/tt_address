Breaking changes
----------------

Set exclude value in flexform fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All fields of the extbase variant flexform have been improved by defining `<exclude>1</exclude>`.
This makes it possible to limit an editor to specific fields of the plugin.

If editors are allowed to create and edit plugins of tt_address (extbase variant) you must enable the needed fields
in the backend usergroup configuration after updating from version 4.0.0.

If only admins are allowed to create and edit plugins, no action is required.
